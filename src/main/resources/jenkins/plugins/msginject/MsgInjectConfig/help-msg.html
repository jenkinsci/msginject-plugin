<div>
    <p>Used to inject a message into the Gerrit Trigger plugin's build summary
    comment at the end of all builds.</p>

    <p>One example for this feature is to use it to return the log location of
    a build in cases where logs and / or archives are shipped off of
    Jenkins to another service elsewhere.</p>

    <p>
    <b>Example Message:</b>

        <pre>
        Logs: https://logs.example.org/jenkins/jenkins001/$JOB_NAME/$BUILD_NUMBER
        </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Example Result:</b>
    <pre>
