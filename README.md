Message Inject Plugin
=====================

This plugin's purpose is to use a Gerrit Trigger comment extension
point to inject additional custom messages into the Gerrit Trigger
comment messages. One use of this is to additionally list a link to
the logs server in cases where log archives are offloaded to another
system.

The custom message is configurable via Global configuration.
